<h5 color="blue">üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lauren Anderson!</h5>
<h5>üìç I'm currently located in Gainesville, FL</h5>

<span color="blue"><b>About Me:</b></span>         
I was born in Florida and I grew up in Costa Rica, where I discovered my passion for traveling and learning about the worldüåé  I've always been intrigued by technology and finally, back in December of 2021, I decided to take the plunge and leave my career in veterinary medicine to pursue Software Engineering full time. To kickstart my education, I chose to attend Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive, where I've acquired over 1,000 hours of coding experience with JavaScript, React, Node and more! 

<b>Skills:</b>   
<b>Languages -</b> JavaScript / HTML / CSS  
<b>Frontend -</b> React / Redux / Express / Node   
<b>Backend -</b> MongoDB / Mongoose / MySQL   
<b>Testing + Deployment -</b> Mocha / Chai / Jest / Enzyme / AWS EC2 / Babel / Webpack    
<b>Tools -</b> Git / Terminal / Postman
